		<h1>1. What about learning web development interests you?</h1>

		<h2> I love creating, I’m very visual and I’m always trying to automatize day by day “processes”, so, learning how to make what you have in mind, true, It’s priceless.</h2>

		<h1>2. What steps/research led you to determine that going through a bootcamp was right for you?</h1>

		<h2>I need to work in my timing manage, I was trying to do it by myself but always something made me break it, I needed to make it formal in order to formalize it. Sharing knowledge with others make easier everything.</h2>

		<h1>3. Web development is a life-long career dedicated to learning. Do you enjoy learning? Tell us about a skill or skills you've learned that demonstrate lifelong learning.</h1>

		<h2>All that you really want, you can do it. I know it sound very clishe, but, I came to USA 2 years ago from Venezuela without any English more than my motivation to learn it. And now, even when I know that I’m still improving it, I can maintain a conversation and I can take this class without problems.</h2>
